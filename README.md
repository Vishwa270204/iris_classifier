# iris_classifier

A Streamlit web app that classifies Iris flower species using a K-Nearest Neighbors model. Users input sepal and petal measurements in text boxes, with validation ensuring values are numeric and within valid ranges. The app displays dataset previews, visualizations, model evaluation, and predicts the flower type based on user inputs.
